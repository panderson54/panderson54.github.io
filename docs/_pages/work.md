I'm a senior software engineer at Meta on the scaled business team. I've worked across Facebook and Instagram business surfaces since 2018 and have led projects such as new business onboarding for Facebook, live marketing support within Instagram and ads performance optimization. Aside from business work I've had the opportunity to be involved in Meta's COVID-19 and Ukraine crisis response teams. Prior to my time at Meta I was a software engineering consultant across various stacks and industries. I firmly believe that what has served me best is my strong interpersonal and communications skills combined with my core engineering competencies. Significant impact takes collaboration and coordination as well as excellent engineering.   

### Core Competencies:
- Software architecture & design 
- Full Stack software development
- Communication between business leaders and engineering
- Deep understanding of business needs to drive technical requirements 
- Engineering mentorship and career growth 


If you want to talk about work feel free to email me or reach out on LinkedIn. I am not actively looking for new opportunities at this time.
