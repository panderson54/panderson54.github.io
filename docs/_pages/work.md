I'm a staff software engineer at Meta on the scaled business team. I've worked across Facebook and Instagram business surfaces since 2018 and have led work on Meta's advertiser guidance systems, new advertiser onboarding, ads performance, and scaled communications. Aside from business surfaces I've had the opportunity to be involved in Meta's COVID-19 and Ukraine War crisis response teams. Prior to my time at Meta I was a software engineering consultant across various stacks and industries. I firmly believe that what has served me best is my strong interpersonal and communications skills combined with my core engineering competencies. Significant impact takes collaboration and coordination as well as excellent engineering.   

### Core Competencies:
- Software architecture & design 
- Full Stack software development
- Communicating with technical and non-technical stakeholders and leadership
- Deep understanding of business needs to drive technical requirements 
- Engineering mentorship and career growth
